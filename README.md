## Monolithic Architecture

 * All application components tightly coupled as one unit.
 * Both frontend and backend in a single codebase.
 * Scalability and maintenance challenges with complexity.

## Frontend + Backend Separation (Hybrid Monolith)

  * Frontend and backend separated into distinct layers.
  * Provides flexibility in frontend tech, decouples UI from server logic.
  * Backend can remain monolithic.

## Microservice Backend + Monolithic Frontend:

 * Backend divided into Microservices for scalability and independence.
 * Frontend remains tightly coupled, potentially limiting scalability.
